# Multi-class Classification with K-Means and KNN
A python implementation of the k-means clustering algorithm and the k-nearest-neighbours classification algorithm. 

## Details
I used the [Avila dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Avila) for this assignment. Following functionalities were implemented:

- K nearest neighbor for varying values of K
- K-mean clustering for varying values of K
- For K-mean clustering also measure the clustering quality using Davies Bouldin index
- Visualization of data after clustering
- Show the results using accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score
